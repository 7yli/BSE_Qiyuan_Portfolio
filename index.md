# Project Name Here
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

For my first milestone, I successfully assembled the robotic arm and tested all the electrical components, including servos and joysticks. I also managed to control the arm using a joystick. The robotic arm consists of 4 servos, several bearings, and is controlled by an Arduino Nano board. Although I encountered some challenges during the process, I resolved them by reviewing the source code and experimenting with different configurations.

The Arduino board is crucial to the functionality of the robot. It processes signals from the joystick and sends commands to the robotic arm based on these inputs. When activated, the Arduino waits for joystick movements. Moving the joystick sends a signal to the Arduino, which then calculates the necessary adjustments to the servos, allowing the arm to move to the desired position.

During the build, I faced a significant issue where the arm began moving erratically and would return to its original position, even though it had previously been functioning correctly. Initially, I suspected a misconfiguration of the servos. However, after checking the code and monitoring the servo angles by printing out servo angle data in the arduino monitor, the data in the Arduino matched the actual angles. Which means that it's not the problem of mis configuration. I then observed that the arm functioned correctly when connected to a computer but not when powered by a battery. This led me to believe that the issue was related to insufficient battery voltage. Replacing the battery resolved the problem. In retrospect, I realized that the prolonged connection between the arm and the battery had likely depleted the batteryâ€™s charge.

Next, I plan to integrate a Raspberry Pi with the Arduino to handle tasks requiring higher computational power, while the Arduino will continue controlling the mechanical components. I will also implement object recognition software on the Raspberry Pi. Ultimately, I aim to combine control of the robotic arm with object recognition to enable automatic object pickup by the arm.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
